# Project start: 23/02/21
I have created the initial project files from visual studio and have setup a trello board to keep track of tasks. I still need to finish a scene to renderer because I couldn't find high enough quality assets.

## Inspiration
I because heavily inspired by my obsession with the Evangelion Movies and the Neon Genesis: Evangelion anime so I wanted to try to create a simple but beautiful looking render of Eva unit 01 in a moody and dense environment surrounded by buildings.
