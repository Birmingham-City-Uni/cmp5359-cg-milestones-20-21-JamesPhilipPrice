# Project start: 23/02/21
I have created the initial project files from visual studio and have setup a trello board to keep track of tasks. I still need to finish a scene to renderer because I couldn't find high enough quality assets.

## Inspiration
I because heavily inspired by my obsession with the Evangelion Movies and the Neon Genesis: Evangelion anime so I wanted to try to create a simple but beautiful looking render of Eva unit 01 in a moody and dense environment surrounded by buildings.

# Timeline
## 23/02/21 - Project start
Initial visual studio project creation and upload of basic blender scene
## 25/02/21 - Started work on Image class and colour struct
Created the image class with the ability to write images and change pixel colours
## 26/02/21 - Progress on blender scene
Worked on building models and putting stuff together
## 02/03/21 - Get the render utility class working on models
Have a wireframe render of a testing model from module labs.
Currently an issue with offsetting the model and need to look back into the vector transformations lectures and math support

## 03/03/21 - Got blender scene to a decent state
I would be happy at this point to use this scene as-is and export it to render
